## Introduction

Welcome to our project repository! This project aims to explore the potential of Neuro-Psychological Procedures backed by Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the Indian Criminal Justice System. Our goal is to address the challenges associated with traditional procedures, such as the lack of reliability and potential harm, and to introduce a transformative HealthTech solution to rectify these issues.

### Did You Know?

With almost two million people incarcerated in India, there are tens of thousands of innocent individuals who are unjustly convicted. We believe that the transformative power of HealthTech, along with ML-based neuro-psychological procedures, can help rectify this injustice.

## Problem Statement

The Indian Criminal Investigation System faces challenges in utilizing traditional procedures such as Narco-Analysis Tests, Polygraph (Lie Detection Tests), and Brain Mapping Tests (Brain Fingerprinting). These procedures often lack individual validation, raising concerns about their accuracy and reliability. This repository addresses these issues and proposes a comprehensive solution.

## Proposed Solution

Our solution involves the integration of Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to improve the precision and reliability of neuro-psychological procedures. We also introduce an Advanced Distress Alert System with a Mental Health Evaluator to enhance the well-being of individuals throughout the investigative process.

## Features

- **Machine Learning for Enhanced Accuracy:** We leverage ML algorithms to make neuro-psychological procedures more accurate and reliable.

- **Deep Learning for Predictive Analysis:** Deep learning models are used to provide precise conclusions in complex situations.

- **Advanced Distress Alert System:** This system helps in identifying and mitigating potential harm to individuals undergoing investigations.

- **Mental Health Evaluator:** We focus on the well-being of individuals involved in the criminal justice process, ensuring their mental health is safeguarded.

## Installation
